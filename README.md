# IntroToProbabilityBook

This is the OReilly book 'Intoduction to Probability'

There will be an 'R' folder where I will directly run the 'R' code.

In src/IntroToProbability.hs will be attempt to embed the 'R' code into haskell.
This is not working, so instead I will try to re-create the code in haskell.
Chap1: see ''sampling' on stackage.
